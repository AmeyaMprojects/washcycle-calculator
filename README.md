## Wash Schedule Tracker - A PyQt Application

This project provides a PyQt application to help you track your laundry schedule.
### Background 

"So,
 a bit of background for this code. I am one and a half weeks into my university's first year. And we have a laundry system in place that provides us with 30 wash cycles over the entire academic year. I was having a hard time planning my wash dates to optimally use my 30 wash cycles. This is the reason this code exists! (Please note that I have hardcoded the program to suit my university's parameters. This may change in the future.)"

### Features

* Enter the number of washes you've done so far.
* Calculate remaining washes and days left in the semester based on a pre-defined start and end date.
* View a schedule of your upcoming wash days.


### Instructions

1. Enter the number of washes you've done in the designated field (between 0 and 30).
2. Click the "Calculate" button.
3. The output box will display the remaining washes and a schedule of your upcoming wash days.

### Disclaimer

The  start and end dates for the semester are hardcoded in the program modify the source code as needed!. 

### Future Improvements

* **Customization:** Allow users to input their own semester start and end dates to accommodate different academic calendars.
* **Multiple wash cycles:** Consider supporting multiple laundry rooms or machines with different cycle limits.
* **Integration with calendar apps:** Integrate with popular calendar apps to automatically add wash days to users' schedules.
* **Visualization:** Create a visual representation of the remaining washes and days, such as a progress bar or pie chart.
